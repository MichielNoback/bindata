To be used in bioinformatics education.
Only datasets, no functions are exported!

## Installation

In the R console type `devtools::install_github("https://github.com/MichielNoback/bindata")` (after installing and loading devtools if required of course).

Then load it as usual `library("bindata")`

Use `help(package="bindata")` to see full documentation, or type e.g. `?bindata::snakes` for info on a single dataset.
